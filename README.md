# Spring.Adobe

A Spring Boot version of the Adobe Order tracker and user registration service. the
same XML files for the .net core version can be used with this application. I'm still
adding some extra features to this version so it will be updated. While JPA creates 
the database you will need to create the procedurein insert.sql and run the grant in
mysql-proc-grant.txt to enable inserts to work as desired.

Spring Tool Suite 3.9.2, Java 8 and Maven 3.5.2, Spring Boot 1.5.9.RELEASE.
